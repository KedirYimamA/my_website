My core expertise lies in designing epidemiological studies, analysing complex datasets, and interpreting results using advanced statistical and machine learning methods to generate actionable insights from health data. My research focuses on understanding of how modifiable risk factors influence population health, particularly in the context of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. I am especially interested in uncovering causal dietary and lifestyle risk factors using modern analytical approaches that combine traditional epidemiology with causal inference, machine learning, and spatial analysis."
